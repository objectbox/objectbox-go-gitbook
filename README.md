### v0.9.0 (2019-04-24)

* Fixed macOS build and 32-bit query support.

### v0.9.0-rc (2019-02-22)

As we queued up quite a few changes, we're doing a release candidate first for you to test:

* Improved relations support
* Embedded structs
* Custom [value-converter ](custom-types.md)to store unsupported types & structs that can't be inlined/prefixed
* Recognize and handle type aliases and named types used as entity fields
* New Box methods: CountMax(), IsEmpty(), Contains() and PutAsyncWithTimeout()
* Query support AND & OR (combine conditions)
* New Query methods: [Limit, Offset](queries.md#limit-offset-and-pagination)
* New Query methods: [Set\*Params (type-based) ](queries.md#reusing-queries-and-parameters)- to run a cached query with custom  parameters
* Query LT|GT|Between support for unsigned numbers
* Support numeric string ID in the entity
* Support for`[]string` as a field type
* Optional pass/return-by-value for slice-of-structs in the generated code
* Change strings to use hash-based instead of value-based indexes by default
* A new option to AlwaysAwaitAsync that can be enabled during initialization

### v0.8.0 (2018-12-06)

* New [Query API](queries.md)
* Box and Query do not require manual closing anymore
* Support for [renaming entities and their properties](schema-changes.md) using UIDs

### v0.7.1 (2018-11-30)

* Fixed wrong mapping for Go types (u)int and (u)int8. Luckily we noticed this very early: if you used those types in previous versions, please delete old database files.
* Transactions are now safely aborted in case of panics

### v0.7.0 (2018-11-29)

* Changed file name of generated code, e.g. file endings for model is now ".obx.go"
